## site.pp ##

# This file (/etc/puppetlabs/puppet/manifests/site.pp) is the main entry point
# used when an agent connects to a master and asks for an updated configuration.
#
# Global objects like filebuckets and resource defaults should go in this file,
# as should the default node definition. (The default node can be omitted
# if you use the console and don't define any other nodes in site.pp. See
# http://docs.puppetlabs.com/guides/language_guide.html#nodes for more on
# node definitions.)

## Active Configurations ##

# PRIMARY FILEBUCKET
# This configures puppet agent and puppet inspect to back up file contents when
# they run. The Puppet Enterprise console needs this to display file contents
# and differences.

# Disable filebucket by default for all File resources:
File { backup => false }

# Randomize enforcement order to help understand relationships
ini_setting { 'random ordering':
  ensure  => present,
  path    => "${settings::confdir}/puppet.conf",
  section => 'agent',
  setting => 'ordering',
  value   => 'title-hash',
}

# DEFAULT NODE
# Node definitions in this file are merged with node data from the console. See
# http://docs.puppetlabs.com/guides/language_guide.html#nodes for more on
# node definitions.

node sshastri.puppetlabs.vm {

  notify { "Liberty and Justice for All" : }
  include nginx

}

node default {
  # This is where you can declare classes for all nodes.
  # Example:
  #   class { 'my_class': }
  notify { "Watermelon and Hotdog for the 4th!" : }

  include role::classroom
  include users
  include skeleton
  include nginx
}
